# San Francisco Ford GoBike Project

## Executive Summary
#### What is the project's main purpose?

This project seeks to explore Ford's Go Bike trip sharing data in San Francisco Bay Area 2019 using various data analysis methods ranging from Descriptive to Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA). This project is carried out using various techniques like data wrangling (gathering, assessing and cleaning), data visualization, and explanatory data analysis.

#### What are some of the key findings and conclusions drawn from your analysis?
As a result of the analysis carried out, here some of the key findings and conclusions considered includes:
* Most riders were between ages of 30 to 40years regardless of gender.
* Most trips were made during morning and afternoon, GoBike is popular with office commuters and students with frequency of bike sharing peaking at 8am to 9am during office and school going hours, and from 5pm to 6pm during office and school closing hours. Also, Thursdays happens to be most popular with riders, whilst there isn't much biking during weekends.
* There's negative trend between the bikers age and trip frequency as people tend to make less trips as they age older. 

## Introduction
#### Overview
The dataset contains 183,412 records of trips, and 16 different features including start time, end time, start station, end station, and latitude/longitude for each station.The dataset contains few numeric variables and categorical variables.

#### What are the problems tackled in this project?
The problems tackled in this project explores the data further giving us insights inot the trends, characteristics and features that hidden the data to help us make more informed data driven decisions. Here are some of the problems tackled:

* What is the age distribution of bikers?
* What is trip frequency by bikers?
* What is the relationship between bikers age and the amount of trips they take?

#### Why is the project important?
This projects gives us insights into Ford's bike trip data and customer's (bikers behaviour). Moreover, the project covers each step of the data analysis process in a chronological order from data gathering, data assessment and cleaning, data exploration, data visualization to sharing findings to perform thorough analysis on the data in question.

#### Where is this data sourced from?
The data used in this project is one of three projects carried out during Udacity Data Analyst Nanodegree Program. The data is provided by Udacity for the sole purpose of building projects utilizing the data analysis process.

## Methodology
The main methods utilized to carry out analysis involves:

* Descriptive Data Analysis
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## Results/Data Analysis
Here are some of the results generated from the analysis made:

The visualization here shows the age distribution of Go Bike users in with large chunk of riders within the age of 30 to 40 in both gender with least number of bikers ranging between 70 to 80 years.

Unsurprisingly, most trips were made during morning and afternoon. The peak in this periods shows that GoBike is popular with office commuters and students with frequency of bike sharing peaking at 8am to 9am during office and school going time and from 5pm to 6pm during office and school closing times. Also, Thursdays happens to be most popular with riders, whilst there isn't much biking during weekends.




Looking at the relationship between  age and trip durations, a negative trend was spotted as number of trips deline astronomically as users age. Go Bikes are popular with office commuters and college students as most active Go Bike riders are between ages of 25 to 35. One daily basis, casual or unsuscribed riders tend to make 7% to 15% of the trips taken each day. Saturdays have the highest average time spent on trips. Also, females and casual riders have the highest trip duration meaning they are more popular with long trips eventhough they take the least trips. Males are complete trips much more earlier and are likely to take short trips. The dataset is limited to February with only few days in March.


## Key Insights for Presentation

1. Go Bike users are largely male dominated. More advertisement needs to geared toward how cycling benefits females and other, to encourage them more
2.  Go Bike is popular with office commuters and students
3. Most active Go Bike riders are between ages of 25 to 35
4. Casual or unsuscribed riders tend to make 7% to 15% of the trips taken each day
