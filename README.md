# San Francisco Ford GoBike Project

## Dataset

This project seeks to explore Ford's Go Bike trip sharing data in San Francisco Bay Area 2019. The dataset contains 183,412 records of trips, and 16 different features including start time, end time, start station, end station, and latitude/longitude for each station.The dataset contains few numeric variables and categorical variables.


## Summary of Findings

In exploring the distribution of both duration_sec and age features, I found that most trips taken were short trips between 300 to 600 seconds. Most riders were between ages of 30 to 40years. Investigating the user type feature, I observed that 90.7% riders were subscribers yet only 9.9% had joined or agreed to join the bike share for all program. Also, 74.6% riders appear to be males and only 23.3% were females, other gender 2.1%. I also observed, trip frequency peaked at 8 to 9am and 5 to 6pm respectively. Thursdays happens to be most popular with riders, whilst there isn't much biking during weekends. Both Market St at 10 St and San Francisco Caltrain Station happen to be busiest start and end stations.

Looking at the relationship between  age and trip durations, a negative trend was spotted as number of trips deline astronomically as users age. Go Bikes are popular with office commuters and college students as most active Go Bike riders are between ages of 25 to 35. One daily basis, casual or unsuscribed riders tend to make 7% to 15% of the trips taken each day. Saturdays have the highest average time spent on trips. Also, females and casual riders have the highest trip duration meaning they are more popular with long trips eventhough they take the least trips. Males are complete trips much more earlier and are likely to take short trips. The dataset is limited to February with only few days in March.


## Key Insights for Presentation

2.  Go Bike is popular with office commuters and students
3. Most active Go Bike riders are between ages of 25 to 35
